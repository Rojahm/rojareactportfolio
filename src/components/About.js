        <p>
          born in 1987. I have a bachelor's degree in I.T. engineering from
          Iran, Tehran, University of Science and Technology, and a master's
          degree in E-Commerce from Tehran University, these years are the ones
          I have to consider wasted! I learned coding with C++ which was very
          unfriendly to me. years later I studied Linux OS and bash scripting
          for months and became interested! in the developer's world, I think I
          belong to the back! by nature and I love Linux concepts and
          philosophy. but I need to see the result enough times to trust myself
          to dive in. thanks to SheCodesFoundation I was honored to take the
          most amazing workshops for front-end developers and decided to stay in
          front! and have fun. I love the freelance lifestyle which gives me
          time to explore myself and learn new things every day.
