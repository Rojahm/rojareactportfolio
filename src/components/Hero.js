          Roja Hosseini - EMEA based front-end developer currently i’m building
          HTML, CSS, JS mixed projects everyday and have fun with it 🤘. I was
          an I.T. administrator for about 10 years🤓, then it got boring and now
          I’m studying new I.T and cloud☁ technologies and freelance front-end
          developer. Swimming 🏊‍♀️ and bicycle riding 🚴‍♀️ are my activities. I also
          practice Piano 🎹 and study music theory 🎶.
