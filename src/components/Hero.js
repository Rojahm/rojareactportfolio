          HTML, CSS, JS mixed projects everyday and have fun with it 🤘. React

          got boring and now I’m studying new I.T and cloud ☁ technologies and
          freelance front-end developer. Swimming 🏊‍♀️ and bicycle riding 🚴‍♀️ are
          my activities. I also practice Piano 🎹 and study music theory 🎶.
